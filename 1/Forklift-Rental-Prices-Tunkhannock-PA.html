<h3>Why Manual Pallet Jack Safety Is Important Tunkhannock PA 18657</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>The high-lifting capability of the reach truck makes it an ideal fit for distribution centers facing a shrinking labor pool and pressure to maximize vertical storage space to accommodate inventory growth driven by e-commerce. On double-end control baggage-type trucks or trucks which may be transported on short elevators, means should be provided to prevent unintentional folding of the operator's folding platform.</p>
