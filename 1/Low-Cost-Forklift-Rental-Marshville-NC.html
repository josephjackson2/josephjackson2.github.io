<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.

If your company utilizes a very narrow aisle operation this classification of lift trucks is for you.</p>
