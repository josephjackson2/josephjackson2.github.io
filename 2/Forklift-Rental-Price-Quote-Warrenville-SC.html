Also known as stand-on and electric riders, standup trucks are easier to maneuver than sit-downs and can work in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>Gregory Poole is proud to offer the best forklift rentals selection in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. We'll cover below what each forklift is, what it's best used for, and popular manufacturers and models. The durability and reliability of these reach trucks will help in minimize your truck downtime and total cost of ownership. The lift handle is attached to an electrical air pump at the base of the forklift.</p>
<p>An important aspect of forklift operation is that it must have rear-wheel steering While this increases maneuverability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver's traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. They can reach heights up to 390â€³ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. Shock absorbers manage the kinetic energy that travels through your Jeep's suspension and chassis as you drive to give you a bump-free ride and keep other components from wearing out too quickly.</p>
<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>

While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

Whether you have seasonal business, a temporary increase in workload, or are taking on a special project with a definite endpoint, leasing a forklift is probably the way to go. And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>
