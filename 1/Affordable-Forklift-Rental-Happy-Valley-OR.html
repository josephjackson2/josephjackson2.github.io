<p>Driving a couple of inches higher will not only offer you a much better view of the road, but your vehicle's body and lower parts will also be considerably safer from flood water and street debris. Forklifts range in size depending on their function. A forklift is a mobile machine that uses two prongs, or forks, to lift and place loads into positions which are ordinarily difficult to reach.</p>
<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>
<h2>Fork Lift Rental Happy Valley</h2>

In 2019, counterbalance forklift trucks accounted for more than 60% industry share. Mid-Ohio Forklifts, Inc., has a complete line of heavy-duty equipment to meet your material handling needs.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>

Included with the compressor will be a revolutionary "smart sensor" used to make sure your truck is always sitting at the proper ride height, regardless of what you are loading or towing.</p>

<p>Sleep soundly knowing that your business is covered when you buy a new forklift, used forklift or rent a forklift from us. Outdoor forklifts use pneumatic tires with deep treads and more ground clearance to make them easier to drive on rough terrains.
