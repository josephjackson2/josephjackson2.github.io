<p>Although Hangcha's 35 series of rough-terrain forklifts hasn't moved to electric yet, Wang says Hangcha has developed the A160 16 T electric forklift to meet market demand. It turns out that lifted trucks do more than just look cool — this modification brings some key benefits.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
