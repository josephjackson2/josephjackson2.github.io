Larger Tires: You're able to attach larger tires to a lifted truck to get more traction off road or in snow.</p>

PLS Kits are available for most of the popular vehicle applications and can be completely removed if necessary. The point of these vehicles seems mostly to project an obnoxiously aggressive attitude over all other drivers. If you're passionate about off-roading , then lifting your truck is a great choice.</p>
<p>These types of kits suspend the frame, body, engine, and the powertrain all above the wheels. Again, it largely will depend on the nature of your business, your warehouse size and specifically what you intend to use the forklift for. Do not operate forklifts inside vehicles for long periods without ventilation.
