<p>We manufacture, export, import and supply a wide range of equipment for Floor Transportation comprising of Electric Pallet Trucks, Scissor Hand Pallet Trucks, Hydraulic Hand Pallet Trucks and Electric Platform Trucks. Load Backrest Extension should have height, width, and size of openings (not to exceed 6 inches in one of the two dimensions) sufficient to minimize the possibility of the load from falling toward the mast when the mast is in a position of maximum rearward tilt.</p>
<p>Driving a couple of inches higher will not only offer you a much better view of the road, but your vehicle's body and lower parts will also be considerably safer from flood water and street debris. Forklifts range in size depending on their function. A forklift is a mobile machine that uses two prongs, or forks, to lift and place loads into positions which are ordinarily difficult to reach.</p>

<h2>Toyota Fork Truck Arlington</h2>
<p>If your company has an old forklift on its way out, get in touch. Counterbalance forklifts are one of the most popular types of powered industrial trucks used today, and the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires counterbalance forklift training for any operator using this type of lift.
