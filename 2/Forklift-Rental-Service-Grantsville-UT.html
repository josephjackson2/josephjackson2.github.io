Overloading a vehicle beyond its capacity or carrying unstable loads.

<p>Sunbelt Rentals offers a variety of forklift equipment for any type of project. So, unless you're asking for a specific type of lift truck by name, you likely want a forklift. Our type of forklift at the Western Illinois University physical plant is a sit down rider type with the forklift that has a counterbalance in the rear. No forklift operator can predict every possible event.</p>
<p>Pallet jacks you see at Walmart and other department stores. This Construction Plant Competence Scheme (CPCS) training course is aimed at those who operate a Rough Terrain Forklift in a construction environment and have successfully completed the CSCS Health, Safety and Environment touchscreen test for Operatives within the past two years.

<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. PLS Kits are available for most of the popular vehicle applications and can be completely removed if necessary. The point of these vehicles seems mostly to project an obnoxiously aggressive attitude over all other drivers. If you're passionate about off-roading , then lifting your truck is a great choice.</p>
