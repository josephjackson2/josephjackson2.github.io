If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>

<h3>Forklift Truck Companies Sandersville GA</h3>

<p>Forklifts weigh thousands of lbs. For true off-road operations requiring superior traction, there are also four-wheel drive rough-terrain forklifts. From a higher center of gravity to reduced visibility in close quarters, a lifted truck or SUV certainly comes with additional roadway safety challenges. While a dealership may not seem like the obvious choice to install your vehicle's lift kit, Currie's years of rigorous training, certification and experience in lift kit installation has made them the go-to experts in suspension enhancement.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres.
