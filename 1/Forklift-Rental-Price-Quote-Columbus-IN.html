Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors.

<h3>Heavy Duty Forklift Columbus IN</h3>
<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important for operators to complete FLT counterbalance license training and receive their forklift operator certification. Many models of rough terrain forklifts are also 4-wheel drive; also available in 2-wheel. Electric forklift batteries last 6 consecutive hours or throughout an 8-hour shift with 2-3 breaks. ProLift Toyota Material Handling works with our trusted manufacturers to carry replacement parts for all your material handling equipment.</p>
<p>Free Lift = The vertical distance the forks can be raised before a mast begins to telescope. The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet. The hydraulic forks spread up to 2.22 metres gives excellent possibilities to handle long loads such as steel beams and plastic pipes but also conventional pallets. At Cat® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application.</p>
