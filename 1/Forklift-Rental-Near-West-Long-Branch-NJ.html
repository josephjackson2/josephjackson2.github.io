Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>With a body lift, clearances are increased for larger tires without the changes to suspension height or alignment angles.
