The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance.

It is important to be aware of the potential hazards of order picker trucks. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>

<p>Typically, these types of vehicles are known as forklifts or lift trucks. When you buy a pallet truck then you will come across many varieties in the market. It is common for indoor electric forklifts to use cushion tires. Rough terrain forklifts are essential material handling equipment on many worksites. A different type of forklift is to be used. Other key features include an intuitive multi-function control handle, patented open view mast, low step height, ductile iron baselegs and an exclusive suspension system for superior load stability.</p>
