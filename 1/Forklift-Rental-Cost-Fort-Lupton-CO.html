<h3>Used Forklift Price Fort Lupton CO</h3>
<p>Short-term requirements - If you only use the equipment to smooth out business operations during busy months or for a limited period, buying a forklift might be too costly. If you already have one of our electric forklift trucks, it can be easily retrofitted with lithium-ion power. They are also sometimes referred to as pallet trucks, pallet pumps, and pump trucks.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>When off-roading, big lifted trucks must rebound after they jump in the air and make contact with the ground.

<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
