<p>LP engines, propane, diesel forklifts and more. Choosing the right forklift is important for your business. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard. But for serious off-road enthusiasts, getting a truck lifted or buying an existing lifted truck should certainly be a consideration at least. Order pickers have a different steering control and they can turn sharper than a usual forklift.</p>
<p>With FLC's training, they'll learn how to properly and safely drive both regular and three-wheel counterbalance lifts, maneuver their way through tight spaces, properly handle and travel with heavy loads and avoid collisions, falling objects and other types of accidents. Don't pay for a 5,000 lb. capacity truck to move 2,000 lbs. If it is not meant for roller chain pulleys then forklifts would require much taller cylinders to lift up the load to an equivalent height.</p>
