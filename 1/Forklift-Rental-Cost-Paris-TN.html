<p>This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used. The operator should never use the forklift as a personal lift unless wearing the proper harness and safety equipment. Counterbalance forklift trucks, the most common type, its forks protrude from the front of the machine, with no outriggers or baselegs to support the load.</p>
<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
