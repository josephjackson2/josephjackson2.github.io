<p>Also, events like National Forklift Safety Day, hosted by the Industrial Truck Association, Washington, D.C., offer lift truck manufacturers the opportunity to educate customers, policymakers and administrators on best practices and the importance of proper training.

<p>This alone should be reason enough to ensure your operators are properly trained where safety and health regulations are involved. New and used Reach Trucks are also available depending on the length of rental and budget. Suspension lift kits are best for drivers who are avid off-roaders because they give you additional ground clearance. Industrial counterbalance forklifts can be used in a wide range of applications, like agricultural, beverage distribution and bottling, and retail industries.</p>
