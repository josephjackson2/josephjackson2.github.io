<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards.

Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials.
