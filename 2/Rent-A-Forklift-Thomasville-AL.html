We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>

Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods.
