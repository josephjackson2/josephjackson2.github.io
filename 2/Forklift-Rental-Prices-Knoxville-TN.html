With our years of industry experience, we are able to successfully cater to the variegated demands of our clients by offering them Standard Pallet Truck.

<p>Also, the Entry Bar Safety Switch at the compartment opening on Crown's stand-up and counterbalance reach trucks slows the truck to a stop and sounds an alarm if operators attempt to drive the truck with part of their foot resting on the ledge.
