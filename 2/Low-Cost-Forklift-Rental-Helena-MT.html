Forklifts are rated for loads at a specified maximum weight and a specified forward center of gravity This information is located on a nameplate provided by the manufacturer, and loads must not exceed these specifications.</p>

Comparable to the height capacity of a standard forklift, the outrigger legs on the front of the machine can support the load up to more than 30 feet.
