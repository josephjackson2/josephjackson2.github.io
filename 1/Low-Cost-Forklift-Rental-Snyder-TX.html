<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. On October 4, 2017, United Rentals announced it had acquired the assets of Superior Speedie Portable Services, Inc. With proper care and maintenance, a lifted truck provides many benefits for the off-road adventure seeker. We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>

LP, gas diesel, electric, pneumatic or cushion, we have the forklift rental you need.</p>

Unlike most car repairs or upgrades, lifting a truck requires a little more effort than getting a few gearhead friends together on a Sunday afternoon to gather around a toolbox and a twelve-pack.</p>
<h2>Hand Pallet Truck Snyder</h2>
<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>The operator stands in the sideways compartment while the forklift loads on its side, making it easier to maneuver through tight spaces. Our full fleet of forklifts, cranes and hoists provide ample strength, lift height, versatility, and the performance features needed for most applications. We supply only high quality, safe, reliable equipment and forklifts and will facilitate everything from selecting the right forklift, helping with finance arrangements, to a seamless delivery.</p>
