<p>Huge inventory of new and used forklifts ready to ship in most states. The powered industrial truck safe practice of wearing a seat belt adheres to manufacturer's recommendations. Many providers suggest being prepared to spend at least $100 per day for a standard 5,000-pound forklift, more for heavier equipment. Class IV forklifts are rider fork trucks, with cabs and seated controls, internal combustion engines, and solid or cushion” tires.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
