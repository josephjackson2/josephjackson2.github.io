<p>Our range of products include Order Picker Forklift and Forklift Truck. Ground clearance same as cushion tire forklift. This forklift is available for rent. However, the additional weight and size from wheels or tires will put more resistance on your lifted truck and may cause extra wear and tear. Read on to learn the Pros and Cons of stand-up forklifts. We provide learners with the skills and knowledge to correctly, safely and legally operate a range of Fork Trucks in the workplace.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

The Rental Department of Raymond Storage Concepts strives to provide quality equipment and solutions to your short and long-term rental needs. The answer is similar to electric forklifts above. A walkie stacker forklift is designed for the operator to walk behind the truck and steer it through an attached handle.</p>

Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits. Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
