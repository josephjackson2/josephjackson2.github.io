<h2>Truck Lift Belgrade</h2>
<p>Space the fork evenly from the center stringer of the pallet to balance the load. You would have to determine whether or not you are operating on a ramp, how heavy the load is, the kind of condition the pallet truck is in, and the distance you have to cover. If you've bought it from a store, it was probably lifted from its place on the shelf by a worker many feet in the air with an order picker forklift.</p>

<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. I notice two things right off the bat; one, the truck looks just about at home up there on that lift kit as it does on its stock ride height; and two, it hasn't seemed to have aged.</p>
