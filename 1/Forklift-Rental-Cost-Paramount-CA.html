Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>With capacities ranging from 2,500 to 36,000 pounds, Cat Lift Trucks delivers fuel-efficient lift trucks for greater productivity and advanced electric forklifts with longer run times and a lower total cost of ownership. Lift Capacity: 4000 lbs. Manufacturers of industrial trucks make a widespread contribution throughout the U.S. economy.

Pallet jacks from Grainger provide leverage to help you lift heavy pallets full of inventory or materials in the warehouse, on the loading dock or at the jobsite.
