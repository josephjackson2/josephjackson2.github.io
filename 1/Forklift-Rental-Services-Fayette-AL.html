<p>Sfikas said all car manufacturers want to know the people who are installing the kits and ensure they are doing so without tampering with the integrity of the vehicle. The catch is that you do have to test for various types of lift trucks. Here at Ultimate Rides, we breath eat and sleep lifted 4×4 trucks and jeeps.

<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you.
