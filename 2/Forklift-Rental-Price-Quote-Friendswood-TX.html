<p>The Toyota Forklifts website is owned by the Toyota company, and is the definitive resource for renting quality approved equipment. BlueLine rental team members are encouraged to spend time with their rental customers to learn about their precise needs. It may be tempting to buy one of the lifted trucks for sale in Phoenix without test driving it. But don't do it.
