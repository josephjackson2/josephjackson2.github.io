Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>Before settling on what forklift to purchase or rent, be certain you've got a good idea of the weights and dimensions of the loads you intend to lift.

They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.

In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>
