<p>At least 22% of these deaths were caused by forklift overturns and another 20% to workers on foot being struck by the forklift. In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 12, we present our annual ranking of the 10 (actually, 11 due to a tie for 10th place) largest global manufacturers of forklifts, as ranked by revenue. Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>Those who operate powered forklifts must pass classroom training and a driving test before being licensed. One of our most popular and material handling equipment in demand is Electric Pallet Trucks. Highly versatile low-lift pallet skid handler for loads 3,000 - 8,000lbs. The electric forklift is a forklift truck powered by an electric motor instead of an internal combustion (IC) engine using either rechargeable industrial batteries or external ways of conveying power.</p>
<p>Most Trucks have custom suspension lift kit, off-road accessories, custom exhaust systems, billet grilles and much, much more here at Kutztown Auto. Since jacks are often electric, with some training, the same weight that is putting your employees at risk for injuries is moved with a touch of a button. The unit is compatible with all types of forklifts so that you can easily move within your facilities.</p>

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck.
