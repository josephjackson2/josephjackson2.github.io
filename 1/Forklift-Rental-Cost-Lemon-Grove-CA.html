<h3>Truck Mounted Forklifts Lemon Grove CA 91945</h3>
<p>Hiring a forklift means that you won't have to rent or buy a permanent forklift and can merely acquire one for the busy period in order to pick up the slack.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
