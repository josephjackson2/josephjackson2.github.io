<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites. Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>Double-deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay.
