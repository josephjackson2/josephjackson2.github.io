A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck.

<p>A rental can also serve as a test drive,” allowing you to test out different types of equipment to determine what you want to purchase.
