<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>Why not check out our selection of used forklifts or contact us for more information.

<p>You can rent a forklift quicker than you can buy. Maximal rough terrain forklift is a tough, compact forklift with a two-wheel drive system. The process of transforming a regular truck into a lifted truck is going to take a lot of thought, a lot of parts, and some very specific equipment in order to do it safely, correctly, and legally — but the results can be pretty impressive.</p>
