<h2>Counterbalanced Forklift Trucks Coeburn </h2>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.).

<p>While most know forklifts the main function of material handling, in fact, there are many different categories of these.
