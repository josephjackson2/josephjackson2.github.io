<h2>Reach Truck Avenal</h2>
<p>These developments constitute a dramatic departure from the norm, according to Brett Wood , chairman of the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) and president and CEO of Toyota Material Handling North America. A reach truck provides a range of features to help you to do the job. Indoor forklifts come with cushion tires to make it easier to maneuver on smooth warehouse floors.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>It will allow you to efficiently pick goods on a pallet and quickly move from rack to rack as well as give you the ability to drive the lifter into a container in order to unload goods.

Included with the compressor will be a revolutionary "smart sensor" used to make sure your truck is always sitting at the proper ride height, regardless of what you are loading or towing.</p>
