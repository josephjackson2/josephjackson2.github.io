Whether they be a factory-floor, rough terrain, or telehandler machine, forklifts often face far harder service than most farm machinery.

<h3>What Are Forklift Trucks Smyrna DE 19977</h3>
<p>The load could also fall off or cause the forklift to tip. Stand-up trucks are the most common and are often used where there's only one load per bay. We rent counterbalance forklifts, rough terrain forklifts, high-reach telehandlers, 360 degree rotating telehandler forklifts , electric and manual pallet jack forklifts by the day, week, month, or longer. Discover how today's lift trucks and batteries are revolutionizing the way companies operate for tomorrow.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
