<p>According to HST , Stand-Up trucks are the most common and are often used where there's only one load per bay. Providing you the best range of hand pallet truck, high lift pallet truck, pallet truck - stainless steel, pallet truck - roll, special size pallet truck and super low pallet truck with effective & timely delivery. At Bridgewater Chevrolet, we make sure when you get your lifted truck serviced, your alignment is checked, and a realignment is performed when necessary.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Beyond the size and power source, when choosing a forklift you need to evaluate a variety of factors that impact your long-term cost, including how much and how high the machine can lift, how careful you need to be when manipulating the load in sensitive areas and whether you should buy or rent a forklift. The Multi-Task Control Handle allows operators to manage travel direction and speed while maneuvering during lift and reach operations.</p>
