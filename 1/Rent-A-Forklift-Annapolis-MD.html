<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>

Serving the materials handling needs of the Reno and Norther Nevada area for nearly 50 years, Reno Forklift is the premier provider of materials handling equipment to the Reno area, including all types of pallet jacks.
