<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites. Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>The Teletruk offers typical savings of up to 30% on operating costs compared to a masted forklift truck. No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job. Models through 16,000 pounds lift capacity use a standard 100-horsepower engine; the next two larger models use a 142-horsepower engine; and the largest model, the LK30P44, has a 225-horsepower engine.</p>

<p>A pallet jack that is too long will make it difficult to maneuver around your warehouse, and one that is too short may not fully support the load and become an unstable safety risk. Robotic technology is estimated to be used across the Class III Forklift Trucks over the forecast period. If you plan to use a rough terrain forklift in a confined space, dimensions are important.</p>
