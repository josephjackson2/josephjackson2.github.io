It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>

<p>Our counterbalanced fork trucks are ideal for operations that require breakdown of pallets removed from trailers, long runs to P&D stations, or a combination of both. Larger items may be attached to a pallet or have indents for fork lifting built into the item itself.

<p>Much more significant than any of the other forklift classes, class 7s are almost exclusively used outdoors to carry the most substantial materials to the loading docks or storage.

There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
<p>This German company is arguably the best material handling organization in Europe. Masts with two, three, or even four sections allow choosing a lift height best suited to particular operations, and the free-lift feature offered on some masts (allowing the forks to raise without extending the mast) makes working in low-overhead situations much easier.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
