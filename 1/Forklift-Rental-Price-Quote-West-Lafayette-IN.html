If the employee was hired: The initial training and evaluation of that employee must be completed: Before December 1, 1999 By December 1, 1999 After December 1, 1999 Before the employee is assigned to operate a powered industrial truck.</p>

For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
