<h3>The Electric Pallet Truck East Alton IL 62024</h3>
<p>Class VI - Class VI trucks are tractors with either electric of internal combustion engines. Narrow Aisle Forklifts : Use: Primarily used indoors on smooth surfaces where space is a premium. The 2017 sales numbers of 253,146 exceeded most industry expectations,” says Brian Feehan, president of ITA. Parking lot safety is an important part of owning a lifted truck.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
