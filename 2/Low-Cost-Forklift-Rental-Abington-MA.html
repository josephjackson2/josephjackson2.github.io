<h2>Cat Lift Truck Abington</h2>
<p>This workshop is designed for participants who have little or no working knowledge of operating a counterbalance forklift. Do not steer pallet jacks onto uneven surfaces and avoid steep inclines. Also known as a large capacity forklift, the industrial forklift is essential for a warehouse with heavier loads. Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile and can be used in many areas of a production operation from the loading dock to the storage facility.</p>

This is among a very good quality pallet truck with great durability and support. Call to discuss load types and warehouse limitations for your safety and accuracy. The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>

They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
